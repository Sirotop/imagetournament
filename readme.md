# Image Tournament

Make choice of the best thing easier with the Single bracket 64-image torunement. 

It should even work with not even number of images. Works on any platfrom: Windows, Linux, macOS

## Story
I needed to choose between hundreds of Geneative art images I was creating. And I came up with an idea to just run a torunament between all of the images. 

Now you can play such a fun Friendship-breaking games like: "Best meme of 2020s" or "Who is the best actor?". Just run it localy on your machine, light up TV or a projector and invite friends over. 

## How to run it locally?
1. Download the code
2. Have about 64 images(maybe more, maybe less) and put them into the "/images" folder
3. Use [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)(free version on their website) or use Python or Node.js server

## How to run it on the website
1. Download code to the virtual machine
2. Run server on the virtual machine
3. Configure your server somehow...

## Where design?
This webapp has a very simple design as I didn't need more. Feel free to modify it to make it look better to your eye
